# Deprecated targets

Targets that I'm not in a position to maintain right now. Perhaps they'll come
back from the dead one day. (MACOSX especially; I don't own any computer that
runs that at the moment...)

Do not expect any of these targets to build.

- `MACOSX`: macOS / Mac OS X
- `NDS`: Nintendo DS
- `OLDMAC`: Classic Mac OS
- `UNIX`: raw X11
- `XPLAT/OSGLUGTK.c`: GTK (Linux)
- `XPLAT/OSGLUSDL.c`: SDL 1.2 (or lower?); might be useful for archaic systems

While compatibility with old/esoteric operating systems is neat, the primary
focus will be on SDL2 moving forwards.
