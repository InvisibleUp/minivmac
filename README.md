# Mini vMac (fork by InvisibleUp)

Forked from Mini vMac by Paul C. Pratt (http://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac), which was forked from vMac by Philip "PC" Cummins (http://www.vmac.com)

Mini vMac is a small, simple emulator for early Motorola 68000 based emulators. Currently we support systems from the original Macintosh 128K all the way up to the Macintosh II.

This fork was created to clean up and modernize the code base, make the project easier to compile and hack on, and allow for much easier user configuration.
