# µvMac 0.37.0

Forked from Mini vMac v36.4 by Paul C. Pratt (http://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac), which was forked from vMac by Philip "PC" Cummins (http://www.vmac.org/main.html)

µvMac (micro vMac) is a small, simple emulator for early Motorola 68000 based emulators. Currently we support systems from the original Macintosh 128K all the way up to the Macintosh II.

This fork was created to clean up and modernize the code base, make the project easier to compile and hack on, and allow for much easier user configuration. The intent of Mini vMac was to create a "emulator collection" of many very optimized "variations" of the same codebase. I consider this much more trouble than it's worth, and intend to focus more on maintainability and accuracy.
