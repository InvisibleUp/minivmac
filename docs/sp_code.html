Youcan make as many copies as you want, and give them to anyone,under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p><p>I will email the code to you. Unfortunately, email is not alwaysreliable. If you don&rsquo;t receive it within a couple days,first check your spam folder. If it is not there, then contact meusing the <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/feedback.html">feedback</a> form,giving your name, the email address on your donation, and adifferent email address (and/or street address to mail a letter).</p><h4> Some fine print </h4><p><a name="asterisk"><b>*</b></a>A Sponsor Code code can be used to request up to 25 variationseach day, every day for a year.</p><p>The Variations Service only promises to build variationsaccurately from the public Mini vMac source. No guarantee is madethat the built variations are suitable for any purpose.(Please <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/feedback.html">report any bugs</a>.)It is possible that some variations can not be built at all due tobugs in the Mini vMac source. Otherwise, requested variations will bebuilt eventually, but there is no guarantee of how long it will take,due to hardware failures and such issues. </p><p> : </p><p> Next - <b><a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/wishlist/index.html">Donation Page</a></b> </p><hr><div><i> <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">minivmac</a>/sp_code- <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2017 Paul C.
