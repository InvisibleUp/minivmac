Instead, options can be chosenat compile time. You can compile a variation of Mini vMacwith options you desire following the instructions on the<a href="build.html">Build</a>page. </p><p> Or, I can compile variations for you. <p><p>With a<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/wishlist/index.html">donation to the Gryphel Project</a>of ten dollars or more, you will receive a&ldquo;<a href="sp_code.html">Sponsor Code</a>&rdquo;that can be used to request custom variations, as many as youcould reasonably want for a period of a year. Youcan make as many copies of these variations as you want,and give them to anyone, under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p><p>Without a Sponsor Code, you can request Demo versions, thatare identical to the regular version,except that the word &ldquo;Demo&rdquo; floats around the emulatedscreen.</p><a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html"><img src="https://www.gryphel.com/d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><h4> Directions </h4><p> Select the options you desire from the<a href="var/mnvm0159.html">Mini vMac Variations Service (Basic)</a>page, including your Sponsor Code if you have one, thenpress the &ldquo;Make custom variation&rdquo; button at top.</p> <p>In around 5 seconds, a page will appear with a download link.Click on the link to download your compiled variation. (You shouldprobably also save the page, to record the options chosenand other details.) You can also verify md5 checksumand message signature displayed on the page.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Variation Server has been double checking,by compiling the variation a second time. If you reloadthe page with your web browser (another 5 seconds or soafter the page first appears), a line at the bottom thatsaid &ldquo;Preliminary Result&rdquo; should change to&ldquo;Final Result (both compiles match)&rdquo;. Otherwise,an error will be displayed.</p><p>To prevent taking too much space on my hosting provider&rsquo;scomputers, older custom variations will eventually be removed.So please download your variation promptly.</p><p> After you download the variation,extract the application from the archive, and place theappropriate ROM image file into the same folder,just as is done for the  standard compile of Mini vMac.Mini vMac does not create preference files or change registry settingsor make any other changes to your computer. So there is no problem inhaving multiple variations of Mini vMac installed.</p></p>The Basic Variations Service offers only afew options. Many more options can be accessed through the<a href="vara_srv.html">Advanced Variations Service</a>.For updating an existing variation, either to change some optionsor to use the same options in a newer version of Mini vMac,there is also the<a href="vart_srv.html">Text Based Variations Service</a>.</p><h4> Some fine print </h4><p>The Variations Service only promises to build variationsaccurately from the public Mini vMac source. No guarantee is madethat the built variations are suitable for any purpose.(Please <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/feedback.html">report any bugs</a>.)It is possible that some variations can not be built at all due tobugs in the Mini vMac source. Otherwise, requested variations will bebuilt eventually, but there is no guarantee of how long it will take,due to hardware failures and such issues. </p><p>The Variations Service is reproducible.That is, if you ask for the same optionstwice, you will get the exact same application archive. (Thefile name will be different, but the contents are the same.)The Sponsor Code used does not effect theresulting Variation, so two sponsors requesting the samevariation will get the same result. (With no Sponsor Code, ademo is created, which is different from the sponsoredvariation.)</p><p> : </p><p> Back to - <b><a href="var/mnvm0159.html">Mini vMac Variations Service (Basic)</a></b> </p><hr><div><i> <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">minivmac</a>/var_dir- <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2018 Paul C.
