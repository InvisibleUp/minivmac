<p>
The µvMac emulator allows modern computers
to run software made for early Macintosh
computers, the computers that Apple sold from 1984 to 1996
based upon Motorola's 680x0 microprocessors, most notably the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Plus">Macintosh Plus</a>.
</p>

<p>
	µvMac began in 2020 as a spin off of the program Mini vMac. Mini vMac,
	while great, was inflexible and very difficult to maintain. This fork
	was created to clean up and modernize the code base, make the project
	easier to compile and hack on, and allow for much easier user
	configuration. The intent of Mini vMac was to create a "emulator
	collection" of many very optimized "variations" of the same codebase.
	I consider this much more trouble than it's worth, and intend to focus
	more on maintainability and accuracy.
</p>

<p>
	The &ldquo;micro&rdquo; in the name refers more to the side and simplicity
	of the codebase than of any particular binary. That said, having every
	possible system emulated by one single program would, in fact, be smaller.
	Also it was meant to imply that this comes "after" Mini vMac.
</p>
	Besides the Macintosh Plus, there
	are also emulations of the Macintosh 128K, 512K, 512Ke,
	SE, Classic, and SE FDHD.
	Work is in progress on Macintosh II emulation, which seems to be mostly
	stable from what testing I've done.
