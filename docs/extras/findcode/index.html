LaunchFindCode and you will see a simple text editingwindow. Type a location within the "bin" file thatyou believe contains code, in hexadecimal notation.For example, "2A" (without the quotes),for an offset of 42 (decimal) from the beginningof "bin". Then choose the "Go" command from the"File" menu. </p><p> Assuming there is code at offset 42, FindCode willfind every instruction that it thinks can definitelybe reached from there, and add this to the file"bin_map". (The file is created if it doesn't alreadyexist.) It will also create labels for thetargets of branches and other memory accesses within"bin" that it can identify, and add them to thefile "bin_names". (This file also is created if itdoesn't already exist.) It will not changelabels that already exist in "bin_names". </p><p> If FindCode thinks that an invalid instructioncan definitely be reached from the startingoffset you specified, it will give an error messageand make no changes to "bin_map" and "bin_names". </p><p> When FindCode is done, it will automaticallylaunch FDisasm if it is located in the samefolder. You can then enter other locationsinto FindCode and choose the "Go" command.FindCode will open and close the "bin_map"and "bin_names" files every time the "Go"command is chosen, so you can manually editthese files and still leave FindCode running. </p><p> You can specify more than one starting offset,separated by spaces or returns. </p><p>Here is the md5 checksum for the download, signed with<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/keys/k5.html">Gryphel Key 5</a>:</p><blockquote><pre>--------- GRY SIGNED TEXT ---------efba08018ae7cdd01e6e68066f3a2cf9 findcode-1.1.0.zip------- BEGIN GRY SIGNATURE -------Gry/4Xa8CFcUzxdN/IdOitw2A0Gu6IdLW0B7pR/2qxh/z3pM7Yi9eUbH7RRk7BPLQlryT1lAmu2mUZ7//uKz7G5YoTEzvE0Sv0T66P8RtAn8AUbWmONO78CXcxeTJRNRtz2s8Q9rUavz8MSK5klD7piqze/9T7tCQ8QvYMk33cwzrHd3h8UKMVYkJsZbz5XV-------- END GRY SIGNATURE --------</pre></blockquote><p> See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling FindCode from the source code. </p><p> You can redistribute FindCode and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
