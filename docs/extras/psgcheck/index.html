PSgCheck isgenerally compatible with MacPGP, but it is easier to legallydistribute, since it doesn&rsquo;t do cryptography. Since it only doesone thing it should also be easier to use. PSgCheck only handles asubset of signed messages that MacPGP does.</p><p>PSgCheck has been replaced by<a href="../sigcheck/index.html">SigCheck</a>,which uses a different format, &ldquo;GRY&rdquo;. The &ldquo;GRY&rdquo;format is much simpler, and therefore shorter.</p><p>To attempt to mitigate weaknesses of md5, the GRY signature formatuses two different md5 checksums, the normal one, and the md5checksum of the input bytes in reverse order. It also includes 3 byteCRC checksums in normal and reverse order, and 2 bytes of versioninfo to make a 40 byte digest (320 bits). 384 bits is the minimumkey size supported by SigCheck, which means the maximum digestsize which can be encoded in the signature is 384 bits.It is hopefully harder to construct two files where these 40 bytedigests match than it is to make the 16 byte md5 checksums match.</p><p>The signature format used by PSgCheck only uses the 16 byte md5checksum as a digest. Currently md5 is generally consideredhopelessly weakened, and unsuitable for any purpose. However, as far asI know, there is still no publicly known practical&ldquo;Preimage&rdquo; attack, which is what is most important forsigning. That is, if I create a file that has a certain md5 checksum,there is no practical way known yet for someone else to construct adifferent file with the same checksum. But it is possible to create twofiles with the same md5 checksum. So you have to be careful aboutsigning a statement that you have looked at a file created by someoneelse, with a given md5 checksum, and it is good. Because they might haveanother file with the same checksum that isn&rsquo;t good.And you have to be careful about signing a statement that contains asignificant amount of text from someone else, especially if your textthat precedes their text is predictable. Which seems to be what happenedto Microsoft with the &ldquo;Flame&rdquo; malware.</p><p>Here is the md5 checksum for the download, signed with<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/keys/k5.html">Gryphel Key 5</a>:</p><blockquote><pre>--------- GRY SIGNED TEXT ---------0c0c7595afb4c5f80eed669c9579697a psgcheck-1.1.0.zip------- BEGIN GRY SIGNATURE -------Gry/4Xa8CFcUzxdN/FGldTdJwYKeOhZAQlL95gcFYC0GhlGNfIPVF7R535S78Dh28abQczZlQjk4P4hVOPLAyTkiADAF6AExOXhANcQEK4qeD0vdTHmKQ4URIGZVq6lYwHfV21nkoPVCOKMGvWOnBM4vK3H/IhUam2OZY5qaeFD7zLipNHDu3f17+aa1sQoP-------- END GRY SIGNATURE --------</pre></blockquote><p> See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling PSgCheck from the source code. </p><p> : </p><p> If you find PSgCheck useful, please consider<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</a>,of which it is a part. </p><a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html"><img src="https://www.gryphel.com/d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><hr><div><i> <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="../../index.html">minivmac</a>/<a href="../index.html">extras</a>/psgcheck- <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2018 Paul C.
