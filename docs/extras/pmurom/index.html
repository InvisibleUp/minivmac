It may work on the MacintoshPortable, and PowerBooks 100, 140, 170, 160, and 180.It was made at the request of<a href="http://rbelmont.mameworld.info/">Arbee</a>(AKA <a href="http://retroblast.arcadecontrols.com/articles/belmont.html">R. Belmont</a>),to assist the <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> emulator project. </p><p> It was made from Arbee's specification, but it is not yet tested.(I don't have the hardware to test it myself. My PowerBook 100 is dead.) </p><p> To use, just launch the PMURom application. Itshould write out a file named "PMU.ROM" (to the folder containingthe application) and then immediately quit. </p><p> On a machine without the right kind of PMU, PMURommay or may not detect that, and give an error message.(If it doesn't, a crash is likely.) </p><p> PMURom can be used evenon a machine without a working keyboard, mouse,and/or screen. This can be done by preparing afloppy disk with PMURom set to be the startupapplication (in System 6 or earlier, not System 7),and replacing the finder with the"<a href="../autoquit/index.html">AutoQuit</a>"application. Make sure there isenough free disk space for the ROM image file. </p><p> The ROM image files that PMURom saves arecopyright Apple Computer, and may not beredistributed. </p><p>Here is the md5 checksum for the download, signed with<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/keys/k5.html">Gryphel Key 5</a>:</p><blockquote><pre>--------- GRY SIGNED TEXT ---------9344ec7c701ecdc25ffdcbe70bcf721b pmurom-1.0.0.zip2be82fef4de2f711d9baf59da1a600bc pmurom-1.0.0.sit.zip------- BEGIN GRY SIGNATURE -------Gry/4Xa8CFcUzxdN/Pb+JM6v7O+/jlAREBussiBYfBvR2gPHaNxitff7YNQjXA6oRFDUfZtFnZaH7iWvM4tYpCRyFhROK8lotCv1GWNa0XFJr0JYYoHWd5Xj9jzj3k/PbNKspzOcIu26Fofhfag7baICGACOfvkUdAk4ZL76kyWZAkEMsTyMLPYPCoYrv9kU-------- END GRY SIGNATURE --------</pre></blockquote><p> See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling PMURom from the source code. </p><p> You can redistribute PMURom and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
